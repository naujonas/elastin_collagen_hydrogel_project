# elastin_collagen_hydrogel_project

This repository contains all important data and code used in the elastin-collagen hydrogel project.

Code and Data are available for deformation experiments (rheology), pore analysis, cell viability and proliferation, and cell invasion. Individual .txt files and microscope images are available upon request from the corresponding author of the manuscript or from Jonas Naumann via jonas.naumann(at)uni-leipzig.de or the GitHub massaging function.

The data in this project were collected and evaluated for the manuscript â€œBiomimetic Elastin-Collagen Hybrid Hydrogels Crosslinked by Energetic Electrons: Towards a Tunable In Vitro Extracellular Matrix Model of the Lung" by Naumann et al. (in submission)
